    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

If a member is elected as Primary within the cluster this connection will be the same as the DeviceRegistration connection. E.g a message addressed to the DeviceRegistration will be forwarded to the ClusterMember connection. * `Unknown` - The node is unable to complete election or determine the current state. If the device has been registered before and the node has access to the current credentials, it will establish a connection to Intersight with limited capabilities that can be used to debug the HA failure from Intersight. * `Primary` - The node has been elected as the primary and will establish a connection to the Intersight service and accept all message types enabled for a primary node. There can only be one primary node in a given cluster, while the underlying platform may be active. If it is active, only one connector will assume the primary role. * `Secondary` - The node has been elected as a secondary node in the cluster. The device connector will establish a connection to the Intersight service with limited capabilities. E.g. file upload will be enabled, but requests to the underlying platform management will be disabled.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "Unknown"  # noqa: E501
            locked_leader (bool): Devices lock their leadership on failure to heartbeat with peers. Value acts as a third party tie breaker in election between nodes. Intersight enforces that only one cluster member exists with this value set to true.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            member_identity (str): The unique identity of the member within the cluster. The identity is retrieved from the platform and reported by the device connector at connection time.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            parent_cluster_member_identity (str): The member idenity of the cluster member through which this device is connected if applicable.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

            shared_scope (str): Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

            permission_resources ([MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type): An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            display_names (DisplayNames): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            api_version (int): The version of the connector API, describes the capability of the connector's framework. If the version is lower than the current minimum supported version defined in the service managing the connection, the device connector will be connected with limited capabilities until the device connector is upgraded to a fully supported version. For example if a device connector that was released without delta inventory capabilities registers and connects to Intersight, inventory collection may be disabled until it has been upgraded.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            app_partition_number (int): The partition number corresponding to the instance of the Proxy App which is managing the web-socket to the device connector.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connection_id (str): The unique identifier for the current connection. The identifier persists across network connectivity loss and is reset on device connector process restart or platform administrator toggle of the Intersight connectivity. The connectionId can be used by services that need to interact with stateful plugins running in the device connector process. For example if a service schedules an inventory in a devices job scheduler plugin at registration it is not necessary to reschedule the job if the device loses network connectivity due to an Intersight service upgrade or intermittent network issues in the devices datacenter.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connection_reason (str): If 'connectionStatus' is not equal to Connected, connectionReason provides further details about why the device is not connected with Intersight.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connection_status (str): The status of the persistent connection between the device connector and Intersight. * `` - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target. * `Connected` - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities. * `NotConnected` - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target. * `ClaimInProgress` - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established. * `UnclaimInProgress` - Unclaim of the target is in progress. Intersight is able to connect to the target and all management operations are supported. * `Unclaimed` - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Targets of type HTTP Endpoint in Intersight. * `Claimed` - Target of type HTTP Endpoint is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target API credentials are incorrect.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of ""  # noqa: E501
            connection_status_last_change_time (datetime): The last time at which the 'connectionStatus' property value changed. If connectionStatus is Connected, this time can be interpreted as the starting time since which a persistent connection has been maintained between Intersight and Device Connector. If connectionStatus is NotConnected, this time can be interpreted as the last time the device connector was connected with Intersight.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connector_version (str): The version of the device connector running on the managed device.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            device_external_ip_address (str): The IP Address of the managed device as seen from Intersight at the time of registration. This could be the IP address of the managed device's interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP address when the managed device is deployed in a private network.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            proxy_app (str): The name of the app which will proxy the messages to the device connector.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

        Keyword Args:
            class_id (str): The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data.. defaults to "asset.ClusterMember", must be one of ["asset.ClusterMember", ]  # noqa: E501
            object_type (str): The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.. defaults to "asset.ClusterMember", must be one of ["asset.ClusterMember", ]  # noqa: E501
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            connected_host (str): The DNS hostname the device connector has used to connect to Intersight. Devices may be configured to connect to a set of DNS hostnames which all resolve to the same Intersight instance, the connected host is the latest hostname the device used to connect successfully to Intersight.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connection_flap_status (AssetConnectionFlapStatus): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            leadership (str): The current leadershipstate of this member. Updated by the device connector on failover or leadership change. If a member is elected as Primary within the cluster this connection will be the same as the DeviceRegistration connection. E.g a message addressed to the DeviceRegistration will be forwarded to the ClusterMember connection. * `Unknown` - The node is unable to complete election or determine the current state. If the device has been registered before and the node has access to the current credentials, it will establish a connection to Intersight with limited capabilities that can be used to debug the HA failure from Intersight. * `Primary` - The node has been elected as the primary and will establish a connection to the Intersight service and accept all message types enabled for a primary node. There can only be one primary node in a given cluster, while the underlying platform may be active. If it is active, only one connector will assume the primary role. * `Secondary` - The node has been elected as a secondary node in the cluster. The device connector will establish a connection to the Intersight service with limited capabilities. E.g. file upload will be enabled, but requests to the underlying platform management will be disabled.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "Unknown"  # noqa: E501
            locked_leader (bool): Devices lock their leadership on failure to heartbeat with peers. Value acts as a third party tie breaker in election between nodes. Intersight enforces that only one cluster member exists with this value set to true.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            member_identity (str): The unique identity of the member within the cluster. The identity is retrieved from the platform and reported by the device connector at connection time.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            parent_cluster_member_identity (str): The member idenity of the cluster member through which this device is connected if applicable.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            sudi (AssetSudiInfo): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            device (AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            account_moid (str): The Account ID for this managed object.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            create_time (datetime): The time when this managed object was created.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            domain_group_moid (str): The DomainGroup ID for this managed object.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            mod_time (datetime): The time when this managed object was last modified.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            moid (str): The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            owners ([str], none_type): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            shared_scope (str): Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            tags ([MoTag], none_type): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            version_context (MoVersionContext): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            ancestors ([MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type): An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            parent (MoBaseMoRelationship): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            permission_resources ([MoBaseMoRelationship], none_type): An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            display_names (DisplayNames): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            api_version (int): The version of the connector API, describes the capability of the connector's framework. If the version is lower than the current minimum supported version defined in the service managing the connection, the device connector will be connected with limited capabilities until the device connector is upgraded to a fully supported version. For example if a device connector that was released without delta inventory capabilities registers and connects to Intersight, inventory collection may be disabled until it has been upgraded.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            app_partition_number (int): The partition number corresponding to the instance of the Proxy App which is managing the web-socket to the device connector.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connection_id (str): The unique identifier for the current connection. The identifier persists across network connectivity loss and is reset on device connector process restart or platform administrator toggle of the Intersight connectivity. The connectionId can be used by services that need to interact with stateful plugins running in the device connector process. For example if a service schedules an inventory in a devices job scheduler plugin at registration it is not necessary to reschedule the job if the device loses network connectivity due to an Intersight service upgrade or intermittent network issues in the devices datacenter.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connection_reason (str): If 'connectionStatus' is not equal to Connected, connectionReason provides further details about why the device is not connected with Intersight.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connection_status (str): The status of the persistent connection between the device connector and Intersight. * `` - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target. * `Connected` - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities. * `NotConnected` - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target. * `ClaimInProgress` - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established. * `UnclaimInProgress` - Unclaim of the target is in progress. Intersight is able to connect to the target and all management operations are supported. * `Unclaimed` - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Targets of type HTTP Endpoint in Intersight. * `Claimed` - Target of type HTTP Endpoint is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target API credentials are incorrect.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of ""  # noqa: E501
            connection_status_last_change_time (datetime): The last time at which the 'connectionStatus' property value changed. If connectionStatus is Connected, this time can be interpreted as the starting time since which a persistent connection has been maintained between Intersight and Device Connector. If connectionStatus is NotConnected, this time can be interpreted as the last time the device connector was connected with Intersight.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            connector_version (str): The version of the device connector running on the managed device.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            device_external_ip_address (str): The IP Address of the managed device as seen from Intersight at the time of registration. This could be the IP address of the managed device's interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP address when the managed device is deployed in a private network.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            proxy_app (str): The name of the app which will proxy the messages to the device connector.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
