    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

            name (str): The name of the task within the workflow and it must be unique among all WorkflowTasks within a workflow definition.

The direct mapping can be specified as '${Source.< input | output | variable>.<JSONPath>}'. 'Source' can be either workflow or the name of an earlier task within the workflow. You can map the task input to either a workflow input, a task output or a variable. Golang template syntax is supported for advanced mapping.

You can map the variable to either a workflow input, a task output or another variable. Golang template syntax is supported for advanced mapping. A simple flattened example is \"VariableParameters\":{ \"var1\":\"${task1.output.output1}\", \"var2\":\"{{ Itoa .global.workflow.variable.varInt}}\" } where variable var1 is mapped directly to output1 of task1 and variable var2 is using a template to convert another variable varInt to string and assign that value..

            label (str): A user defined label identifier of the workflow task used for UI display.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            name (str): The name of the task within the workflow and it must be unique among all WorkflowTasks within a workflow definition. This name serves as the internal unique identifier for the task and is used to pick input and output parameters to feed into other tasks.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            input_parameters (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): JSON formatted key-value pairs that define the inputs given to the task. Mapping for task inputs can be provided as either static values, direct mapping or advanced mapping using templates. The direct mapping can be specified as '${Source.< input | output | variable>.<JSONPath>}'. 'Source' can be either workflow or the name of an earlier task within the workflow. You can map the task input to either a workflow input, a task output or a variable. Golang template syntax is supported for advanced mapping. A simple flattened example is \"InputParameters\":{ \"input1\":\"${workflow.variable.var1}\", \"input2\":\"prefixStr_{{.global.workflow.input.input1}}\" } where task input1 is mapped directly to variable var1 and task input2 is using a template to prefix a string to workflow input1 and then assign that value.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            on_failure (str): This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task fails.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            on_success (str): This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task succeeds.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            rollback_disabled (bool): The task is disabled/enabled for rollback operation in this workflow if the task has rollback support.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of False  # noqa: E501
            variable_parameters (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): JSON formatted key-value pairs that perform variable update at the end of the task execution. Mapping for variables can be provided as either static values, direct mapping or advanced mapping using templates. The direct mapping can be specified as '${Source.< input | output | variable>.<JSONPath>}'. 'Source' can be either workflow or the name of the current or an earlier task within the workflow. You can map the variable to either a workflow input, a task output or another variable. Golang template syntax is supported for advanced mapping. A simple flattened example is \"VariableParameters\":{ \"var1\":\"${task1.output.output1}\", \"var2\":\"{{ Itoa .global.workflow.variable.varInt}}\" } where variable var1 is mapped directly to output1 of task1 and variable var2 is using a template to convert another variable varInt to string and assign that value..
