    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

            api_access (str): API access control for the property.

It cannot be changed after object creation.An HTTP 4xx status code is returned when the user sends a POST/PUT/PATCH request that containsa CreateOnly property.CreateOnly properties are returned in the response body of HTTP GET requests. * `ReadWrite` - The property has read/write access. * `WriteOnly` - The value of the property can be set but it is never returned in the response body of supported HTTP methods.This settings is used for sensitive properties such as passwords. * `ReadOnCreate` - The value of the property is returned in the HTTP POST response body when the REST resource is created.The property is not writeable and cannot be queried through a GET request after the resource has been created.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "NoAccess"  # noqa: E501

            name (str): The name of the property.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            op_security (str): The data-at-rest security protection applied to this property when a Managed Object is persisted. For example, Encrypted or Cleartext. * `ClearText` - Data at rest is not encrypted using account specific keys.Note that data is always protected using volume encryption. ClearText propertiesare queryable and searchable. * `Encrypted` - The value of the property is encrypted with account-specific cryptographic keys.This setting is used for properties that contain sensitive data. Encrypted propertiesare not queryable and searchable. * `Pbkdf2` - The value of the property is hashed using the pbkdf2 key derivation functions thattakes a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generates a password hash.Its purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtaineda password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive. * `Bcrypt` - The value of the property is hashed using the bcrypt key derivation function. * `Sha512crypt` - The value of the property is hashed using the sha512crypt key derivation function. * `Argon2id` - The value of the property is hashed using the argon2id key derivation function.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "ClearText"  # noqa: E501
            search_weight (float): Enables the property to be searchable from global search. A value of 0 means this property is not globally searchable.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            api_access (str): API access control for the property. Examples are NoAccess, ReadOnly, CreateOnly etc. * `NoAccess` - The property is not accessible from the API. * `ReadOnly` - The value of the property is read-only.An HTTP 4xx status code is returned when the user sends a POST/PUT/PATCH request that containsa ReadOnly property. * `CreateOnly` - The value of the property can be set when the REST resource is created. It cannot be changed after object creation.An HTTP 4xx status code is returned when the user sends a POST/PUT/PATCH request that containsa CreateOnly property.CreateOnly properties are returned in the response body of HTTP GET requests. * `ReadWrite` - The property has read/write access. * `WriteOnly` - The value of the property can be set but it is never returned in the response body of supported HTTP methods.This settings is used for sensitive properties such as passwords. * `ReadOnCreate` - The value of the property is returned in the HTTP POST response body when the REST resource is created.The property is not writeable and cannot be queried through a GET request after the resource has been created.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "NoAccess"  # noqa: E501
            default (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): The default value of the property. Not applicable when IsComplexType is True.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            is_collection (bool): Indicates whether the property is a collection (i.e. a JSON array), otherwise it is a single value.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            is_complex_type (bool): Indicates whether the property is a complex type, otherwise it is a basic scalar type.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            kind (str): The kind of the property. * `Unknown` - The property kind is unknown. * `Boolean` - The 'Boolean' kind of property. * `String` - The 'String' kind of property. * `Integer` - The 'Integer' kind of property. * `Int32` - The 'Int32' kind of property. * `Int64` - The 'Int64' kind of property. * `Float` - The 'Float' kind of property. * `Double` - The 'Double' kind of property. * `Date` - The 'Date' kind of property. * `Duration` - The 'Duration' kind of property. * `Time` - The 'Time' kind of property. * `Json` - The 'JSON' kind of property. * `Binary` - The 'Binary' kind of property. * `EnumString` - The 'EnumString' kind of property. * `EnumInteger` - The 'EnumInteger' kind of property. * `ComplexType` - The 'ComplexType' kind of property.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "Unknown"  # noqa: E501
            name (str): The name of the property.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            op_security (str): The data-at-rest security protection applied to this property when a Managed Object is persisted. For example, Encrypted or Cleartext. * `ClearText` - Data at rest is not encrypted using account specific keys.Note that data is always protected using volume encryption. ClearText propertiesare queryable and searchable. * `Encrypted` - The value of the property is encrypted with account-specific cryptographic keys.This setting is used for properties that contain sensitive data. Encrypted propertiesare not queryable and searchable. * `Pbkdf2` - The value of the property is hashed using the pbkdf2 key derivation functions thattakes a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generates a password hash.Its purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtaineda password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive. * `Bcrypt` - The value of the property is hashed using the bcrypt key derivation function. * `Sha512crypt` - The value of the property is hashed using the sha512crypt key derivation function. * `Argon2id` - The value of the property is hashed using the argon2id key derivation function.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "ClearText"  # noqa: E501
            search_weight (float): Enables the property to be searchable from global search. A value of 0 means this property is not globally searchable.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            type (str): The type of the property. In case of collection properties the type is that of individual elements.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
