    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

Prerequisite to use asset targets is to persist the target details. Asset target MoRef can be given as task input of type TargetDataType. Fusion determines and populates the target context with the Assist if associated with. It is set internally at the API level. In case of an associated assist, it is used by Assist to fetch the target details and form the API request to send to endpoints. In case of cloud asset targets, Jasmine fetched the target details from DB, forms the API request and sends it to the target.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

The value extraction is supported for response content types XML, JSON and Text. Optional input to specify the content type in case of error API response. This should be used if the content type of error response is different from that of the success response. If not specified, contentType input value is used to parse the error response..

            name (str): A reference name for this API request within the batch API request. This name shall be used to map the API output parameters to subsequent API input parameters within a batch API task.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            outcomes (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): All the possible outcomes of this API are captured here. Outcomes property is a collection property of type workflow.Outcome objects. The outcomes can be mapped to the message to be shown. The outcomes are evaluated in the order they are given. At the end of the outcomes list, an catchall success/fail outcome can be added with condition as 'true'. This is an optional property and if not specified the task will be marked as success..

Specifying a start delay adds to the delay to execution. Start Delay is not supported for the first API in the Batch and cumulative delay of all the APIs in the Batch should not exceed the task time out.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

Generic API executor service Jasmine can invoke these remote APIs via its executors. Asset targets can be accessed directly for cloud targets or via an associated Intersight Assist. Prerequisite to use asset targets is to persist the target details. Asset target MoRef can be given as task input of type TargetDataType. Fusion determines and populates the target context with the Assist if associated with. It is set internally at the API level. In case of an associated assist, it is used by Assist to fetch the target details and form the API request to send to endpoints. In case of cloud asset targets, Jasmine fetched the target details from DB, forms the API request and sends it to the target.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            body (str): The optional request body that is sent as part of this API request. The request body can contain a golang template that can be populated with task input parameters and previous API output parameters.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            content_type (str): Intersight Orchestrator, with the support of response parser specification, can extract the values from API responses and map them to task output parameters. The value extraction is supported for response content types XML, JSON and Text. The type of the content that gets passed as payload and response in this API. The supported values are json, xml, text.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            description (str): A description that task designer can add to individual API requests that explain  what the API call is about.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            error_content_type (str): Intersight Orchestrator, with the support of response parser specification, can extract the values from API responses and map them to task output parameters. The value extraction is supported for response content types XML, JSON and Text. Optional input to specify the content type in case of error API response. This should be used if the content type of error response is different from that of the success response. If not specified, contentType input value is used to parse the error response.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            label (str): A user friendly label that task designers have given to the batch API request.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            name (str): A reference name for this API request within the batch API request. This name shall be used to map the API output parameters to subsequent API input parameters within a batch API task.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            outcomes (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): All the possible outcomes of this API are captured here. Outcomes property is a collection property of type workflow.Outcome objects. The outcomes can be mapped to the message to be shown. The outcomes are evaluated in the order they are given. At the end of the outcomes list, an catchall success/fail outcome can be added with condition as 'true'. This is an optional property and if not specified the task will be marked as success.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            response_spec (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): The optional grammar specification for parsing the response to extract the required values. The specification should have extraction specification specified for all the API output parameters.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            skip_on_condition (str): The skip expression, if provided, allows the batch API executor to skip the api execution when the given expression evaluates to true. The expression is given as such a golang template that has to be evaluated to a final content true/false. The expression is an optional and in case not provided, the API will always be executed.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            start_delay (int): The delay in seconds after which the API needs to be executed. By default, the given API is executed immediately. Specifying a start delay adds to the delay to execution. Start Delay is not supported for the first API in the Batch and cumulative delay of all the APIs in the Batch should not exceed the task time out.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            timeout (int): The duration in seconds by which the API response is expected from the API target. If the end point does not respond for the API request within this timeout duration, the task will be marked as failed.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
