    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.

                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)

            start_time (datetime): The time when the workflow was started for execution.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            status (str): A status of the workflow (RUNNING, WAITING, COMPLETED, TIME_OUT, FAILED).. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            success_workflow_cleanup_duration (int): The duration in hours after which the workflow info for successful workflow will be removed from database.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of 2160  # noqa: E501
            trace_id (str): The trace id to keep track of workflow execution.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            type (str): A type of the workflow (serverconfig, ansible_monitoring).. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            user_action_required (bool): Property will be set when an user action is required on the workflow. This can be because the workflow is waiting for a wait task to be updated, workflow is paused or workflow launched by a configuration object has failed and needs to be retried in order to complete successfully.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of False  # noqa: E501
            user_id (str): The user identifier which indicates the user that started this workflow.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            wait_reason (str): Denotes the reason workflow is in waiting status. * `None` - Wait reason is none, which indicates there is no reason for the waiting state. * `GatherTasks` - Wait reason is gathering tasks, which indicates the workflow is in this state in order to gather tasks. * `Duplicate` - Wait reason is duplicate, which indicates the workflow is a duplicate of current running workflow. * `RateLimit` - Wait reason is rate limit, which indicates the workflow is rate limited by account/instance level throttling threshold. * `WaitTask` - Wait reason when there are one or more wait tasks in the workflow which are yet to receive a task status update. * `PendingRetryFailed` - Wait reason when the workflow is pending a RetryFailed action. * `WaitingToStart` - Workflow is waiting to start on workflow engine.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "None"  # noqa: E501
            workflow_ctx (WorkflowWorkflowCtx): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            workflow_meta_type (str): The type of workflow meta. Derived from the workflow meta that is used to launch this workflow instance. * `SystemDefined` - System defined workflow definition. * `UserDefined` - User defined workflow definition. * `Dynamic` - Dynamically defined workflow definition.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "SystemDefined"  # noqa: E501
            workflow_task_count (int): Total number of workflow tasks in this workflow.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            workflow_worker_task_count (int): Total number of worker tasks in this workflow. This count doesn't include the control tasks in the workflow.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            account (IamAccountRelationship): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            associated_object (MoBaseMoRelationship): [optional]  # noqa: E501
