    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

            hcl_status_reason (str): The reason for the HCL status when it is not Approved. * `Missing-Os-Driver-Info` - The validation failed becaue the given server has no OS driver information available in the inventory. Either install ucstools vib or use power shell scripts to tag proper OS information. * `Incompatible-Server-With-Component` - The validation failed for this component because he server model and component model combination was not found in the HCL. * `Incompatible-Processor` - The validation failed because the given processor was not found for the given server PID. * `Incompatible-Os-Info` - The validation failed because the given OS vendor and version was not found in HCL for the server PID and processor combination. * `Incompatible-Component-Model` - The validation failed because the given Component model was not found in the HCL for the given server PID, processor, server Firmware and OS vendor and version. * `Incompatible-Firmware` - The validation failed because the given server firmware or adapter firmware was not found in the HCL for the given server PID, processor, OS vendor and version and component model. * `Incompatible-Driver` - The validation failed because the given driver version was not found in the HCL for the given Server PID, processor, OS vendor and version, server firmware and component firmware. * `Incompatible-Firmware-Driver` - The validation failed because the given component firmware and driver version was not found in the HCL for the given Server PID, processor, OS vendor and version and server firmware. * `Service-Unavailable` - The validation has failed because HCL data service is temporarily not available. The server will be re-evaluated once HCL data service is back online or finished importing new HCL data. * `Service-Error` - The validation has failed because the HCL data service has return a service error or unrecognized result. * `Unrecognized-Protocol` - The validation has failed for the HCL component because the HCL data service has return a validation reason that is unknown to this service. This reason is used as a default failure reason reason in case we cannot map the error reason received from the HCL data service unto one of the other enum values. * `Not-Evaluated` - The validation for the hardware or software HCL status was not yet evaluated because some previous validation had failed. For example if a server's hardware profile fails to validate with HCL, then the server's software status will not be evaluated. * `Compatible` - The validation has passed for this server PID, processor, OS vendor and version, component model, component firmware and driver version.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "Missing-Os-Driver-Info"  # noqa: E501
