    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

            hypervisor_type (str): Identifies the broad product type of the hypervisor but without any version information. It is here to easily identify the type of the virtual machine. There are other entities (Host, Cluster, etc.) that can be indirectly used to determine the hypervisor but a direct attribute makes it easier to work with. * `ESXi` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is a Vmware ESXi hypervisor of any version. * `HyperFlexAp` - The hypervisor of the virtualization platform is Cisco HyperFlex Application Platform. * `IWE` - The hypervisor of the virtualization platform is Cisco Intersight Workload Engine. * `Hyper-V` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Microsoft Hyper-V. * `Unknown` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is not known.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "ESXi"  # noqa: E501
            identity (str): Unique identifier assigned to the hypervisor host.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            maintenance_state (str): Expected state of host (enter maintenance, exit maintenance). * `None` - A place holder for the default value. * `Enter` - Power action is performed on the virtual machine. * `Exit` - The virtual machine will be migrated from existing node to a different node in cluster. The behavior depends on the underlying hypervisor.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "None"  # noqa: E501
            model (str): Commercial model information about this hardware.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            name (str): Name of the hypervisor host. It must be unique within the target endpoint.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            serial (str): Serial number of this host (internally generated).. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            vendor (str): Commercial vendor details of this hardware.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
