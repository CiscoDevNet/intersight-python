    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

The schema for the inputs is provided in the Task Definition, hence the data provided in this field should adhere to that schema. Eg- If Task Definition takes two inputs with names A and B, then this field should contain key-value pairs having key as the name of the input and value should be provided matching the constraints of it's respective data type. Value can either be mapped from workflow input or previously executed task outputs or any liternal value.. [optional]  # noqa: E501

When retrying a workflow with failed tasks, the task in workflow engine will have a new instance ID, but the task may still be in progress.

                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            description (str): The task description and this is the description that was added when the task was included into the workflow.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            end_time (datetime): The time stamp when the task reached a final state.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            failure_reason (str): Description of the reason why the task failed.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            input (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): The input data that was sent to the task at the start of execution. The schema for the inputs is provided in the Task Definition, hence the data provided in this field should adhere to that schema. Eg- If Task Definition takes two inputs with names A and B, then this field should contain key-value pairs having key as the name of the input and value should be provided matching the constraints of it's respective data type. Value can either be mapped from workflow input or previously executed task outputs or any liternal value.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            inst_id (str): The instance ID of the task running in the workflow engine.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            internal (bool): Denotes whether or not this is an internal task.  Internal tasks will be hidden from the UI within a workflow.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            label (str): User friendly short label to describe this task instance in the workflow.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            message ([WorkflowMessage], none_type): [optional]  # noqa: E501
            name (str): Task definition name which specifies the task type.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            output (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type): The output data that was generated by this task. The schema for the outputs is provided in the Task Definition, hence the data provided in this field should adhere to that schema. Eg- If Task Definition takes two outputs with names A and B, then this field contains key-value pairs having key as the name of the output and the corresponding value matches the constraints of it's respective data type.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            ref_name (str): The task reference name to ensure its unique inside a workflow.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            retry_count (int): Denotes the number of times the task has been retried.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            rollback_disabled (bool): The task is disabled/enabled for rollback operation in this workflow if the task has rollback support.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of False  # noqa: E501
            running_inst_id (str): The instance ID of the task that is currently being executed. When retrying a workflow with failed tasks, the task in workflow engine will have a new instance ID, but the task may still be in progress. In this case, the task instId reflects the instance ID in the workflow engine, while runningInstId reflects the instance ID of the instance that is currently being executed.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            start_time (datetime): The time stamp when the task started execution.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
