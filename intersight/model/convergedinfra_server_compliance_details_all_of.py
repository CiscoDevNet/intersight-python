    Cisco Intersight

    Cisco Intersight is a management platform delivered as a service with embedded analytics for your Cisco and 3rd party IT infrastructure. This platform offers an intelligent level of management that enables IT organizations to analyze, simplify, and automate their environments in more advanced ways than the prior generations of tools. Cisco Intersight provides an integrated and intuitive management experience for resources in the traditional data center as well as at the edge. With flexible deployment options to address complex security needs, getting started with Intersight is quick and easy. Cisco Intersight has deep integration with Cisco UCS and HyperFlex systems allowing for remote deployment, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. The model-based deployment works for a single system in a remote location or hundreds of systems in a data center and enables rapid, standardized configuration and deployment. It also streamlines maintaining those systems whether you are working with small or very large configurations. The Intersight OpenAPI document defines the complete set of properties that are returned in the HTTP response. From that perspective, a client can expect that no additional properties are returned, unless these properties are explicitly defined in the OpenAPI document. However, when a client uses an older version of the Intersight OpenAPI document, the server may send additional properties because the software is more recent than the client. In that case, the client may receive properties that it does not know about. Some generated SDKs perform a strict validation of the HTTP response body against the OpenAPI document.  # noqa: E501

Either install UCS Tools VIB on the host ESXi or use OS Discovery Tool scripts to provide proper OS information. * `Incompatible-Server` - The validation failed for this server because the server's model was not listed in the HCL. * `Incompatible-Processor` - The validation failed because the given processor was not listed for the given server model. * `Incompatible-Os-Info` - The validation failed because the given OS vendor or version was not listed in HCL for the server PID and processor combination. * `Incompatible-Firmware` - The validation failed because the given server firmware was not listed in the HCL for the given server PID, processor, OS vendor and version. * `Service-Unavailable` - The validation has failed because HCL data service is temporarily not available. The server will be re-evaluated once HCL data service is back online or finished importing new HCL data. * `Service-Error` - The validation has failed because the HCL data service has returned a service error or unrecognized result. * `Not-Evaluated` - This means the HclStatus for the sever has not been evaluated because it is exempted. * `Incompatible-Components` - The validation has failed for this server because one or more components have \"Not-Listed\" status. * `Compatible` - The validation has passed for this server's model, processor, OS vendor and version.. [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "Missing-Os-Driver-Info"  # noqa: E501
